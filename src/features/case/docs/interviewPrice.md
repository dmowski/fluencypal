# 🧠 Psychological Elements to Include

### ✔ “You save 75%” tag on 4-month plan

Since $60/month × 4 = $240 → $90 looks like a steal.

Show it visually:

**Save $150** (compared to monthly)

---

### ✔ Price anchoring

Put the **Monthly Plan** in the center and highlight it.

That makes:

- 1-Week plan feel expensive (high urgency tax)
- 4-Month plan feel like a bargain (value plan)

---

### ✔ Add trust notes below the plans

- Cancel anytime
- No hidden fees
- 100% secure payments
