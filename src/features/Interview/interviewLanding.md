- Focuses on **outcome** → job, salary, offers
- Removes “English” barrier
- Speaks to deeper pain: **rejection**, confusion, bad answers
- Speaks to deeper desire: **offers, salary, confidence, clarity**
- Positions FluencyPal as **Interview Performance Optimizer**, not a language tool
- Much more powerful for ads targeting “job search”, “interview prep”, “CV help”, etc.
